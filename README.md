# Java_to_C-_ManAssign
This is a personal project where i redo an assignment from our java course in the second semester using C# instead of Java.

Full assignment task list below
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks to perform:

The following tasks need to be performed to pass the assignment.

Implement the 6 classes as described above and in the class diagram.
Write a main test class called ContractorTest. In this class do the following:
Create Address objects for two customers
Use the LocalDate class from the java.time package from the Java API to create date objects for the start/end dates for each project
Create two projects, one for a new house and one for a small project to add outdoor motion lighting
Create Address objects for all the workers, the last worker uses an overloaded constructor since this worker has a second address line for the apartment number
Add three workers, an electrician, plumber, and carpenter that can be used on these projects
Add these workers to an ArrayList so that we can assign them to a project
Add all three workers to the house project
Set the lumber costs of the carpenter to $2000 Hint: ((Carpenter)c).setLumberCosts(2000);
Set the general contractor overhead to 18% for this large project
Print out the project information
Repeat the process for the small outdoor motion lighting project
Optional if you implemented the comparable interface: Compare the start dates to determine which project needs to start first and print the appropriate message
Submit the assignment as exported IntelliJ project (in IntelliJ: File -> export to Zip file)
Make sure that your code is running in IntelliJ without a compile error. Otherwise, this will lead to automatic not passed.

In the assignment we also got a implementation class diagram.
